### Design Decisions: 
- *Tech Stack:* To implement the Airline application, our team met in the first scrum and discussed on what the tech stack has to be used and finalized on MERN stack and AWS.
- *Database Design:* In the fouth Scrum meeting we have discussed on what models and attributes to be used inorder to implement all the features proposed.
- *Role level Access:* Our team had different interpretations on how the roles should be developed and how they should be on the website, After having intense discussions, we finalized on just 2 roles : A User(Who can search, book, reserve seat, pay for the flight), An Employee (Who can view all the scheduled flights).
- *Code Reusability:* As most of the Components look similar, we thought of writing core components in such a way that we can reuse them in all places with little effort. We have developed more robust and common APIâ€™s for our backend and common components for frontend.
